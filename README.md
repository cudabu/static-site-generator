## STATIC VS DYNAMIC SITES

A static site is what it sounds like... static. No matter who is interacting with the site, the content is always the same. You can not log in, you can't leave comments, or upload files to a static site. You would need a dynamic site for that stuff, which is usually powered by a database and a custom web server. We'll learn about dynamic sites later, but for now, we're building a static site.

## PRE-REQUISITES

- Git
- GitHub
- Python 3.11+
- A unix-like shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)
